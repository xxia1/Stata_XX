\begin{itemize}
    \item Jonathan Shaw wrote a very nice \textit{Top 10 Stat ``gotchas''}, which highlights some of the pitfalls and quirks in Stata: \url{https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X1501500209}
    \item Gentzkow\&Shapiro Lab's GitHub page has many good materials for technical guides on doing economic research: \url{https://github.com/gslab-econ}, especially their RA manual. Although some of the materials are a bit old, it's still very helpful to read them through. 
    \item Jonathan Dingel has a very nice page with advice and tools for doing economic research: \url{http://www.jdingel.com/teaching/advice.html}. For the purpose of this article, pay special attention to his "Coding" section. 
    \item Christian Hansen et al. put together this page summarizing machine learning tools in Stata: \url{https://statalasso.github.io/}
