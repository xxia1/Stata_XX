\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec_intro}
This project has two main objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item To introduce essential Stata tools for data analysis in research.
\item To present a streamlined project management workflow that integrates Stata and \LaTeX, enabling you to automate the export, presentation, and updating of numbers and exhibits in your reports or drafts.
\end{enumerate}

At the same time, this is designed to be a \textit{meta-}project: This article comes with a companion Git repository [link], which includes all code, exhibits, and folder structure used to generate this article. One can find examples of the tools mentioned in this article in the repository, and can use this repository as a template for other projects. 

A few items (e.g., how to purchase a Stata license) are specific to Duke students, but the majority of the content is broadly applicable.
